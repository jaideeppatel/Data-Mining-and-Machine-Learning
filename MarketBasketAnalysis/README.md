Association Rule mining on Market basket data using Aprori Algorithms

1. Implmented the F_k-1 and F1 apriori algorithm to determine the frequent itemsets of size k = 3, 4 and 5
2. Implmented the F_k-1 and F_k-1 apriori algorithm to determine the frequent itemsets of size k = 3, 4 and 5
3. Tested on an classification/regression data set by converting the feature by discretizing the numerical values
4. Enumerated the closed itemsets and maximal frequent itemsets
5. Implmented confidence based pruning and lift based rule pruning

As a result I could identify the top 10 accociation rules for various combinations of support and confidence thresholds.

Note: No specialized libraries were used in any of the implementation.
All the algoirthms are built from ground level.
